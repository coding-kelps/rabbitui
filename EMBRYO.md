## What is the projectâ€™s objective?

The goal of this project refactor the  [maxmindlin/rabbitui](https://github.com/maxmindlin/rabbitui) project to use the [orhun/ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui) library.

## What value does it bring?

The project aims to revitalize the rabbitui project, proposing a nice RabbitMQ TUI written in rust. And to familiarize ourself (@guilhem-sante, @dfayd0) with the ratatui framework.

## What are the completion criteria?

The project will be considered to have completed its embryo stage when it will replicates all the features of the forked project using ratatui.
Extending the TUI compatible environments at least to Linux.
