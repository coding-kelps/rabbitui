## Installation

### Homebrew

```
brew tap maxmindlin/rabbitui
brew install rabbitui
```

### Building from source

`cargo build --release && ./target/release/rabbitui` builds in release mode and runs the resulting binary.

### Usage

There are a number of cli options for starting up the UI. For help use `rabbitui --help`.

By default, it connects to `http://localhost:15672` with the default credentials. You can change this via cli parameters.

At any time in the application you can press `?` to see a help menu for the panel you are in.
